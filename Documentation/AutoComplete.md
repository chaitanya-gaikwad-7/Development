## 📁 **File Structure Example**
```
project-folder/
│
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── data.json
└── script.js
```
---

## ✅ **How to Run It**
1. Put all four files in the **same folder**.
2. Open a terminal in that folder and run a local server. Example using Python:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```
   (Directly opening `index.html` from file explorer won't load the JSON because of browser security.)
